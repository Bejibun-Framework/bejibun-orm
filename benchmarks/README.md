# Benchmarks

Speed comparison: baseline (previously published npm release) vs the optimized `@bejibun/orm` in this repo.

## Running

```bash
# Run all benchmarks (installs baseline from npm first)
bun run bench

# Or run individually (after install-deps)
bun run install-deps
bun run coldstart
bun run throughput
```

## Cold Start

Measures package import time by spawning fresh OS processes. Two metrics:

- **Full process time** — spawn → exit (includes Bun boot time)
- **Import** — measured inside the process, isolates the package's own import cost

<!-- BENCHMARK:COLDSTART:START -->

|                             | baseline | optimized | speedup   |
| --------------------------- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| Full process (spawn → exit) | 28.6ms   | 28.2ms    | **1.01x** |
| Import                      | 19.0ms   | 18.1ms    | **1.05x** |

## Throughput

The hot paths touched on every orm operation, measured per method. `construction` covers `new OrmBuilder()` plus driver resolution — baseline re-reads the config file from disk and resolves the driver through a fresh enum builder each time; the optimized build uses a ormd config and a module-level driver set. `Orm.put()`, `Orm.get()`, and `Orm.has()` run the full facade against the configured Redis driver. Requires a live Redis server on `127.0.0.1:6379`. 20,000 calls each, median of 15 runs.
